You might be a good fit if you are about to graduate university, or have 0-2 years of experience as a software engineer and can code in Python.\nNo prior machine learning or AI experience is required.\nRead about how our interview process works here: <https://www.mechanize.work/how-our-interview-process-works/>\n## Restrictions\n  * **No telecommuting**\n  * **Agencies are OK**\n\n\n## Requirements\nPython\n## About the Company\nWe are a software company that builds RL environments and sells them to the leading AI labs. Our RL environments simulate real-world work scenarios. Models are dropped into these environments and tasked with completing objectives, such as building a new feature, deploying an application, or debugging an issue. Their work is graded based on how successfully they perform these tasks. These grades serve as reward signals during training, teaching models how to complete real-world tasks effectively.\nWhile we build RL environments, we don’t train models directly. Instead, AI labs use our RL environments for training. We don’t plan to release any consumer-facing products in the foreseeable future. Our current focus is automating software engineering, but our long-term goal is to enable the automation of all valuable work in the economy.

Our RL environments simulate real-world work scenarios. Models are dropped into these environments and tasked with completing objectives, such as building a new feature, deploying an application, or debugging an issue. Their work is graded based on how successfully they perform these tasks. These grades serve as reward signals during training, teaching models how to complete real-world tasks effectively.</p>\n<p>While we build RL environments, we don’t train models directly. Instead, AI labs use our RL environments for training. We don’t plan to release any consumer-facing products in the foreseeable future. Our current focus is automating software engineering, but our long-term goal is to enable the automation of all valuable work in the economy. Our selection of essays below helps explain our vision and worldview:</p>\n\n        \n\n        <h2>Contact Info</h2>\n        <ul>\n            \n            <li><strong>Contact</strong>: Arjun Panickssery</li>\n            \n\n            <li><strong>E-mail contact</strong>: <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"mailto:arjun%40mechanize.work\">arjun<span>@</span>mechanize<span>.</span>work</a></li>\n\n            \n            <li><strong>Web</strong>: <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/mechanize/b50c89dc-001c-4fb6-a4fc-a9f52f35b490?utm_source=python_dot_org\">https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/mechanize/b50c89dc-001c-4fb6-a4fc-a9f52f35b490?utm_source=python_dot_org</a></li>\n            \n        </ul>\n\n        \n\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n    </div><!-- end .job-post-content -->\n\n\n    <div class=\"job-post-meta\">\n        <p class=\"job-meta\">\n            <!-- Company URL -->\n            \n\n            <!-- Date posted -->\n            <span class=\"listing-posted\">Posted <time datetime=\"2026-01-28T23:40:37.677888+00:00\">28 January 2026</time></span>\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"job-tags\">\n            <!-- Job Types -->\n            <span class=\"listing-job-type\"><a href=\"/jobs/type/back-end/\" title=\"More Back end jobs\">Back end</a>, <a href=\"/jobs/type/front-end/\" title=\"More Front end jobs\">Front end</a></span>\n\n            <!-- Company Category (Job Category) -->\n            <span class=\"listing-company-category\"><a href=\"/jobs/category/developer-engineer/\" title=\"More jobs in Developer / Engineer\">Developer / Engineer</a></span>\n        </p>\n\n        \n    </div>\n\n\n</article>\n\n\n<!-- Next or Previous Jobs by date posted -->\n<p class=\"previous-next\">\n    \n        \n        <a class=\"prev-button\" href=\"/jobs/8031/\">\n            <span class=\"prev-button-text\"><span class=\"icon-arrow-left\"><span>←</span></span> Previous</span>\n            <span class=\"prevnext-description\">\n                <span class=\"company-name\">Junior Full Stack Developer, Patrick J.

Our salary ranges are informed by market data from peer organizations in our sector. Our salaries are competitive and equitable and align with peers in the same job group. Because salary ranges are small and the internal parity review is thorough, offers are firm.\nStarting salaries are typically placed in the lower half of the range. Final offers are determined by the scope of the position, the candidate's relevant experience, and internal equity. It is important to us that our hiring process is accessible to everyone. If you require accommodations to participate in the interview process, please let us know when you apply.\nWe may use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to support parts of the hiring process, such as reviewing applications, analyzing resumes, or assessing responses. These tools assist our recruitment team but do not replace human judgment. Final hiring decisions are ultimately made by humans. If you would like more information about how your data is processed, please contact us.\n## Restrictions\n  * **No telecommuting**\n  * **Agencies are OK**\n\n\n## Requirements\nWhat you will need to succeed:\n  * Experience – 1-3 years of professional experience in full-stack development, with proven expertise in both UI development and backend integration.
